Render.com: Backend API hosting
AWS EC2: Web server hosting

## API Integration
The platform integrates with a custom-built RESTful API hosted at https://evuriro-backend.onrender.com that provides the following endpoints:

# Authentication 

POST /user/register: Create new user accounts
POST /user/login: Authenticate existing users
GET /user/profile: Retrieve user profile information


# Appointments

GET /appointments: Retrieve user appointments
POST /appointments: Create new appointments
PUT /appointments/:id: Update existing appointments
DELETE /appointments/:id: Cancel appointments



## External APIs Used
This project integrates with the following third-party APIs:


# Google Maps API

### API Security
The API implements several security measures:

#JWT Authentication: All protected endpoints require a valid JWT token
HTTPS: All API traffic is encrypted using TLS/SSL
CORS: Configured to only accept requests from authorized domains
Rate Limiting: Prevents abuse through request throttling (100 requests per hour)
Input Validation: Sanitizes all user inputs to prevent injection attacks
Secure Storage: API keys are stored in environment variables, never in code

#### Error Handling Strategy
The application implements a comprehensive error handling approach:

Frontend Validation: Client-side form validation to catch errors early
API Error Responses: Standardized error response format with appropriate HTTP status codes
jsonCopy{
  "status": "error",
  "code": 404,
  "message": "Appointment not found",
  "details": "The requested appointment ID does not exist in our records"
}

Graceful Degradation: Fallback UI components when API services are unavailable
Error Logging: Centralized error logging for monitoring and debugging
User Feedback: Clear error messages displayed to users with recovery suggestions
Retry Mechanism: Automatic retry for temporary network failures

Deployment Guide
Web Server Configuration
The application is deployed on two AWS EC2 instances running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS:
bashCopy# Connect to Web Server
ssh ubuntu@54.197.202.33

# Navigate to web directory
cd /var/www/html

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Bonaeineza31/health-project.git

# Set proper permissions
sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu health-project

# Install dependencies
cd health-project
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with production values

# Start application with PM2
pm2 start app.js --name "evuriro"
pm2 save
pm2 startup

# Configure Nginx as reverse proxy
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/evuriro
# Add the following configuration:
# server {
#     listen 80;
#     server_name 54.197.202.33;
#
#     location / {
#         proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
#         proxy_http_version 1.1;
#         proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
#         proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
#         proxy_set_header Host $host;
#         proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
#     }
# }

# Enable the site
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/evuriro /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
The same deployment process was followed for Web Server 02 (3.93.231.111).
Load Balancer Configuration
The load balancer (44.201.230.25) is configured with Nginx to distribute traffic between the two web servers:
bashCopy# Connect to Load Balancer
ssh ubuntu@44.201.230.25

# Install Nginx
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx -y

# Configure load balancer
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/load-balancer

# Add the following configuration:
# upstream backend {
#     server 54.197.202.33;
#     server 3.93.231.111;
# }
#
# server {
#     listen 80;
#     server_name 44.201.230.25 www.bonaeineza31.tech;
#
#     location / {
#         proxy_pass http://backend;
#         proxy_set_header Host $host;
#         proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
#         proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
#         proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
#
#         # Health check
#         health_check interval=10 fails=3 passes=2;
#
#         # Session persistence using IP hash
#         proxy_next_upstream error timeout http_500;
#     }
# }

# Enable the site
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/load-balancer /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
This configuration includes:

Round-robin algorithm for traffic distribution
Health checks to ensure requests are only routed to operational servers
Session persistence to maintain user sessions
Error handling for failed upstream servers

## User Interaction with Data
The platform provides several ways for users to interact with their health data:

1. Searching
Global search functionality allows users to search across all patient data with:

Keyword-based search across all medical records
Advanced search with multiple parameters
Autocomplete suggestions for medical terms
Results grouped by category (Appointments, Records, Medications)

2. Visualization
Interactive charts for vital signs and health metrics:

Line charts for tracking trends over time (blood pressure, weight, etc.)
Downloadable reports in PDF format
Printing records

## Challenges and Solutions
# Challenge 1: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
Problem: API requests from the frontend were blocked by CORS policies when deployed to different domains.
Solution:

Implemented proper CORS headers on the backend
Configured the API to accept requests from authorized domains
Added middleware to Express.js application:
javascriptCopyapp.use(cors({
  origin: ['http://54.197.202.33', 'http://3.93.231.111', 'http://44.201.230.25', 'http://www.bonaeineza31.tech'],
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization']
}));


# Challenge 2: User Authentication
Problem: Needed a secure, stateless authentication system that works across multiple servers.
Solution:

Implemented JWT-based authentication with token refresh mechanism
Stored tokens in HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks
Added token expiration and refresh functionality
Implemented secure password hashing with bcrypt

# Challenge 3: Load Balancing
Problem: Ensuring high availability and consistent user experience across multiple servers.
Solution:

Configured Nginx load balancer with health checks
Implemented session persistence using IP hashing
Set up automatic failover to handle server outages
Added monitoring to track server performance and load distribution

# Testing
The application has been thoroughly tested using:

Cross-Browser Testing: Verified functionality in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
